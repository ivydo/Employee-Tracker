# Employee-Tracker

## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This application allows the user to handle large amounts of data and run the following:

* View All Employees - command that prints all employees in a table. Table contains employee id, employee name, title, department, salary and employee manager.

* View All Employees By Manager - command that prints all employee managers and their associates.

* View All Employees By Department - command that prints all departments and the employee under it.

* View All Roles - command that prints all roles/ title and the corresponding employee.

* Add An Employee - command line that adds a new entry to the database.

* Remove An Employee - command line that deletes an employee from the database

* Update Employee Role - command line that updates the role/ title of an employee.
